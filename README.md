# Pinger
NetCore 3.1 port of a pinger application used to stop my powerlines timing out.

# Purpose
Built as a result of periodically losing connection to my router. Investigation showed people had worked around this by pinging the router to keep the connection alive. 
“Pinger” is a result of creating a similar solution that also incorporates Windows 10 toast notifications and a tray icon.
